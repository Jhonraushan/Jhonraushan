# Jordan Knott - @JordanKnott

Hello friend! I'm Jordan, a SWE who loves building solutions. I'm most familiar with JavaScript (React), Golang, and Python - however I choose whatever technology or language is best for the job. I love learning new things, binge watching Netflix shows, and am attempting to learn French!

## What I currently working on? :purple_heart:

My current personal project is [Taskcafe](https://github.com/JordanKnott/taskcafe/), an open source project management tool written to fit my needs. 

It's also for learning new technologies such as GraphQL.
