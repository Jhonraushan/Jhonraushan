# Jordan Knott - @JordanKnott

Hello friend! I'm Jordan, a SWE who loves building solutions. I'm most familiar with JavaScript (React), Golang, and Python - however I choose whatever technology or language is best for the job. I love learning new things, reading fantasty & sci-fi novels, and building useful tools.
